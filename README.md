# Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices using Python's linear regression. By analyzing the relationship between house size and price, we can build a predictive model and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict house prices based on their size.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Environment**: Developed using Visual Studio Code.

## Visualizations

- **Scatter Plot**: Displays the relationship between house size and price.
- **Regression Line**: Shows the best-fit line predicting house prices.
